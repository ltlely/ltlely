## ABOUT ME

K-Pop Fan 🎶: K-pop is my go-to soundtrack while working on projects or studying. It keeps me motivated and energized!

STEM Advocate 💻: Winning Verizon’s STEM Next award was one of my proudest moments. I love giving back to the community and supporting initiatives that encourage more people to dive into STEM.

Avid Learner 📚: I love learning new things just for fun! Whether it’s a random fact about history or a new tech skill, I'm always curious.

Anime Lover 📺: Anime is my go-to for unwinding! I love immersing myself in different worlds and characters—it’s a great way to relax after a day of coding.

Cat Parent 🐱: I have two cats, and they’re my little coding buddies! They often keep me company when I’m working on projects.
